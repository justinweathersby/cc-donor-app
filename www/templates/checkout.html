You are responsible for regularly reviewing these places for any updates to the T&C. Continued use of our Services or Applications after any updates shall constitute your consent to such all changes to the T&C contained in such update. 
CREATIVE CHATTER DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, WE ARE NOT A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER. IT IS UP TO THE THIRD PARTY DRIVER OR VEHICLE OPERATOR TO OFFER AND PROVIDE THE PICK-UP, CARRY AND DELIVERY SERVICES, WHICH MAY BE SCHEDULED THROUGH USE OF OUR APPLICATIONS OR SERVICES. CREATIVE CHATTER OFFERS INFORMATION AND A METHOD TO OBTAIN SUCH THE PICK-UP, CARRY AND DELIVERY SERVICES, BUT DOES NOT AND DOES NOT INTEND TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES OR ACT IN ANY WAY AS A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER, AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY PICK-UP, CARRY AND DELIVERY SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU THROUGH OUR APPLICATIONS OR SERVICES. 
Our Services Unite Drivers and Senders 
Our Applications and Services make possible a connection between those individuals and/or businesses that want to contract with someone to pick-up, carry and/or deliver personal property and goods (“Senders“) and those individuals and/or businesses seeking to perform the pick-up, carrying and delivery services requested by a Sender (“Drivers“). We refer to the services provided by a Driver as a “Delivery“, and the personal property and goods being picked-up, carried and/or delivered as “Packages“. Drivers and Senders together are referred to as “Users“. 
Driver and Sender Screening 
CREATIVE CHATTER DOES NOT CONDUCT SCREENING OR BACKGROUND CHECKS OF ANY USER FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOWING THEM TO USE OUR APPLICATIONS OR SERVICES. ALL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN USERS ARE AT THE USER’S RISK. 
Creative Chatter does not conduct any background checks or screening processes either before a User can register for our Services or during use of our Services. We do not investigate or verify any User’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information Users may submit to us. 
Notwithstanding the above, Creative Chatter reserves the right to begin conducting such checks and screening of Users at any time as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, including but not limited to verification of identities, criminal background checks (at the Country, State and local level as we deem necessary or appropriate). Creative Chatter also reserves all rights to use such third party services to run such checks and processes as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion. By registering and using the Services or the Applications, each User consents to Creative Chatter conducting any screening processes and/or background checks that Creative Chatter deems advisable and as often as Creative Chatter deems necessary and as may be required for compliance with federal and state laws and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
If Creative Chatter decides to conduct such background checks or screening processes on its Users in the future, Creative Chatter’s performance of the checks shall not be taken as confirmation that any User is who they claim to be. Creative Chatter has no responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of the identity or background check information or any information regarding a User provided through our Services or Applications. 
Any screening process is not a substitute for your good judgment when interacting with other Users. At all times during the use of our Services and Applications exercise caution and use your common sense. Remember that you may not know a User personally and always should take care while working with another User. 
Restrictions on Package Contents 
When arranging a Delivery, a Sender must not include in any Package, and no Driver may knowingly accept any Delivery with a Package that contains (1) any “Creative Chatter Prohibited Item” as listed below, whether consented to by a Driver or not; or (2) any “Creative Chatter Special Items” as listed below unless specifically listed and disclosed to the Driver and consented to by the Driver prior to the Driver accepting the Delivery. 
It is all Drivers’ and Senders’ duty and obligation to know and comply with all applicable federal and state laws in the pick-up and delivery locations of any Delivery and all applicable laws relating to the contents of a Package, including without limitation those laws prohibiting the transportation or shipment of items, restricting the amounts of items that can be shipped, and age restrictions. Creative Chatter has no liability or responsibility if a Driver or Sender fails to comply with all applicable laws. 
Creative Chatter Prohibited Items All Senders are prohibited from including in any Package, and all Drivers are prohibited from knowingly accepting a Delivery or picking-up, carrying or delivering any Package, containing the following personal property: 
 Any “Hazardous Material” as defined by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and codified in Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (49 CFR), not including those Hazardous Materials in small or excepted quantities as defined in 49 CFR; 
 Any animal; 
 Any prescription or over the counter medicine that has not been paid for and is being delivered to a person other than the purchaser or the prescription holder; 
 Any Package that contains items(s) with a value in excess of $5,000; 
 People; 
 Cremated Remains. 

In the event a Package containing a Creative Chatter Prohibited Item is found en route during a Delivery or otherwise, that Package will be stopped at the location of the discovery. Any Driver discovering a Creative Chatter Prohibited Item in a Package shall immediately notify Creative Chatter at support@CreativeChatter.com for further direction. Creative Chatter reserves the right to dispose of the Package in its sole discretion and reserves all rights to instruct its Drivers on how to dispose of the Package, including delivery to the proper authorities. 
Creative Chatter Special Items The following personal property may be included in a Package only if fully disclosed to a Driver and agreed to by such Driver prior to the Driver accepting such Delivery. 
Creative Chatter is not liable for loss or damage to a Creative Chatter Special Item if it is not properly packed to withstand transport and to ensure the safety and integrity of the item and in compliance with all applicable laws: 
 Heavy haul, oversize or overweight items; 
 Prescription drugs and medicines; must be delivered to the prescription holder; 
 Cash, Checks, Phone Cards, Tickets, Credit Cards, Gift Cards, and Similar Cards; 
 Media, i.e. documents, film, photographs (including negatives), slides, transparencies, videotapes, compact discs, laser discs, computer tapes, and media of similar nature; and 
 Heirlooms, one-of-a-kind and like items. 

Creative Chatter Protection Plan 
Creative Chatter wants you to feel confident that your Package is in good hands. The Creative Chatter Protection Plan provides reimbursement for loss or damages arising from theft or property damage to our Senders’ Package arising directly from a Creative Chatter’s negligence in performance and fulfillment of a Delivery up to $250.00 per Package, per occurrence. Creative Chatter reserves the right to cancel any order at any time and is not responsible for improper pricing of goods sold. To qualify for the Creative Chatter Protection Plan, the Sender must declare the value of all items in the Package, complete a claim form and provide proof of value. The complete procedure needed to file a claim can be found at support@CreativeChatter.com. 
PLEASE BE AWARE THAT NO MATTER WHAT VALUE YOU DECLARE FOR YOUR PACKAGE CREATIVE CHATTER’S MAXIMUM LIABILITY TO YOU IS $250.00 
Terms and Conditions to the Creative Chatter Protection Plan The declared value for any Package is not insurance coverage by Creative Chatter but represents Creative Chatter’s maximum liability for all items contained in the Package in the case of loss or damage (not including for Creative Chatter Special Items as further described below). Creative Chatter will not reimburse you more than $250 for any Package, no matter how many items are included in the Package and no matter the actual value for the personal property contained therein. Senders sending Packages containing items with a total value exceeding $250 do so at their own risk. 
Creative Chatter Special Items The Creative Chatter Protection Plan applies to Creative Chatter Special Items differently. If your Package contains Creative Chatter Special Items, Creative Chatter’s maximum liability for the items in that Package is limited as described below and Creative Chatter will not reimburse any Sender in excess of Creative Chatter’s maximum liability for such Creative Chatter Special Item, no matter the actual value. Senders sending Creative Chatter Special Items with values exceeding Creative Chatter’s maximum liability do so at their own risk. 
Creative Chatter is not liable for loss or damage to any Package containing Creative Chatter Special Items if they are not properly packed to withstand transport. 
Senders sending Creative Chatter Special Items that are not properly packaged do so at their own risk. 
Creative Chatter’s liability for certain Special Items is also limited based on the nature of the item: 
 Checks: If a Package containing a check or checks is lost or damaged, Creative Chatter will not pay for the face value of the check(s), and Creative Chatter’s liability for any Package containing a check or checks is limited to the cost of stopping payment on and reissuing the check(s), not to exceed $100 per Package. 
 Phone Cards, Tickets, Gift Cards, and Similar Cards: Creative Chatter’s liability for a Package containing phone card(s), ticket(s) (such as event or airplane ticket), gift certificate(s), gift card(s), coupon(s), or other similar printed matter with an exchange value is limited to the cost of replacing the physical card(s), certificate(s), or printed matter, not to exceed $100 per Package. As with checks, Creative Chatter is not liable for the face value of any phone card, gift certificate, gift card, coupon, or similar printed matter. 
 Media: Creative Chatter’s liability for loss or damage to a package containing documents, film, photographs (including negatives), slides, transparencies, videotapes, compact discs, laser discs, computer tapes, and media of similar nature is limited to the replacement cost of the media on which the content is recorded, not to exceed $250 per Package. 
 Heirlooms, Antiques, One-of-a-Kind etc.: Creative Chatter’s liability for loss or damage to a package containing such items shall not exceed $250 per Package. Sender must provide proof of actual value. This proof may come 


in the form of an invoice, sales receipt, appraisal, or value of a “like” item that can be verified. Creative Chatter cannot and will not reimburse for “sentimental value” as such a value is indeterminable. 

Proof of Value A Sender must prove the value of the item in the Package subject to the claim, regardless of the value declared and Creative Chatter will not pay on a claim, without proof of the declared value. You must also provide documentation that verifies the replacement or repair cost of the item subject to the claim. 
Repair or replacement is defined as the purchase price paid for the item that is the subject of the claim; the actual cost of the damaged or lost item; the replacement cost of the item at the time and place of loss or damage; or for the cost of repairing the damaged item. You must provide a third-party repair quote/evaluation from a qualified repair facility. If the third-party deems the merchandise as un-repairable, the actual or replacement value will be paid up to Creative Chatter’s maximum liability. You must submit all repair quotes as part of the claims process and while Creative Chatter may pay the cost of repair, it is the Sender’s responsibility to have the item repaired. 
In the event of loss or damage to a pair or set of articles, Creative Chatter’s liability is limited to the value of that part of the pair or set that is lost or damaged, and Creative Chatter shall not be liable for the value of the whole pair or set. In the event of loss or damage to any part of an item (including any part of a machine) that, when complete for sale or use, consists of several parts, Creative Chatter shall be liable only for the value of the part lost or damaged, not to exceed the declared value of the part lost or damaged. In no event shall Creative Chatter be liable for the value of the complete item. 
In the event of loss or damage to a pair or set of articles, Creative Chatter’s liability is limited to the value of that part of the pair or set that is lost or damaged, and Creative Chatter shall not be liable for the value of the whole pair or set. In the event of loss or damage to any part of property (including any part of a machine) that, when complete for sale or use, consists of several parts, Creative Chatter shall be liable only for the value of the part lost or damaged, not to exceed the declared value of the part lost or damaged. In no event shall Creative Chatter be liable for the value of the complete item. 
Filing a Claim If you believe your Package is lost or damaged, follow these steps to begin the claims process. It is important to note that only the Sender may file a claim; the recipient of the package cannot file a claim. A recipient who believes a Package has been lost or damaged should contact the Sender of the Package to begin the claims process. 
 In the case of a damaged Package, follow the Damaged Package Claim Process. In the case of damage, keep all of the packaging materials as they may need to be examined as part of the claims process. 
 In the case of a lost Package, follow the Lost Package Claim Process. 
 Please note that, in the case of either lost or damaged Package claims, Sender should keep receipts for all items in a Package. 

Creative Chatter may use a third-party provider to manage the claims process. In cases of damage to a Creative Chatter Special Item, Creative Chatter (or its provider) will analyze the integrity of packaging and associated materials and will determine adequate packaging in its sole discretion.

Cancelation and No-Show Policy 
Cancelation by Senders If a Sender needs or wants to cancel a Delivery, please cancel the request as soon as possible. This will notify the Driver and free them up to accept other Deliveries from other Senders. 
What Happens When a Sender Cancels or is a No Show? A Delivery is deemed a no-show if the Sender cancels the Delivery once a Driver is already on his way to fulfill the Delivery (“Cancelation“). A Sender will be considered a no-show if the Package is not available at the specified location more than 15 minutes after the agreed pick-up/drop-off time without messaging or otherwise contacting the Driver through the Application, or (2) more than 30 minutes after the agreed pick-up/drop-off time, whether or not Sender has contacted the Driver (“No-Show“). If either a No-Show occurs, a $10 no-show fee is automatically charged to the Sender’s account. 
A Sender will not be charged a no-show fee if they cancel a Delivery due to a Driver’s No-Show, or if they cannot contact a Driver during the performance of their Delivery due to failure of the app. 
100% of all Sender Cancelation fees are paid to our Drivers. 
If a Sender has 3 No-Shows then Creative Chatter may suspend or deactivate the Sender’s account, in its sole discretion. 
Cancelation by Drivers If a Driver needs or wants to cancel a Delivery, the Delivery should be canceled as soon as possible. This will notify the Sender and allow them to contact another Driver to accept the Delivery. To cancel a Delivery, tap Cancel on the Delivery Details screen within the Creative Chatter Application. 
What Happens When A Driver Cancels or is a No Show? As with the Sender, a Delivery is deemed canceled if the Driver cancels after accepting the Delivery, provided that a Driver may cancel a Delivery within 10 minutes of being selected for such Delivery without penalty (“Cancelation“). A Driver will be considered a No-Show if he/she fails to arrive at the drop-off/pick-up location more than 15 minutes after the agreed pick-up time without calling, messaging or otherwise contacting the Sender through the Application, or (2) more than 30 minutes after the agreed drop-off/pick-up time, whether or not Driver has contacted the Sender (“No-Show“). 
A Driver will not be charged a fee if they cancel a Delivery due to a Sender’s No-Show or if they cannot accept the Package due to restrictions in these T&C or other restrictions under applicable law. 
If a Driver has 3 Cancelations or No-Shows then Creative Chatter may suspend or deactivate the Driver’s account, in its sole discretion. 
Creative Chatter, may reactivate any Driver or Sender account suspended or deactivated by Creative Chatter in its sole discretion. 
Billing and Payment

Please note that Creative Chatter is not a party to the PSP Agreement and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed in the PSP Agreement are the parties to the PSP Agreement.
